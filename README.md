MAT3UTR(Model-based analysis of the trans effect of 3ʹ-UTR shortening)
======

**Current version**: 0.9.1

Description
-----
To better understand the role of 3ʹ-UTR shortening in regulating ceRNA gene expression, we developed a mathematical model (MAT3UTR) to quantify the trans effect of 3ʹ-UTR shortening to their affected ceRNA partner. MAT3UTR predicts ceRNA expression change based on its 3ʹUS gene(s) expression and 3ʹ-UTR shortening level, miRNA-binding site(s), and miRNA expression(s)
